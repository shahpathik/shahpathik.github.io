*This page presents other evidence of my professional capacity in computer science as required for the [ICS Ph.D. Portfolio](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/ph-d-in-ics/#phd-portfolio). This includes all forms of research, teaching, and service to the community and discipline, including professional vita of employment, professional presentations, reviewing of papers for conferences and journals, competitive fellowships or other external funding awards, patents, teaching, service on committees or as graduate student representatives, and letters of reference.*

## Teaching

### ICS 211

Ran lab for ICS 211 for five semesters which involved creating and grading assignments, assisting in lectures and
providing hands on coding experience for assignments and lab exercises.

## Research

### Lokahi Project

Designed a software framework for the acquisition, persistence, analysis, and reporting of real-time distributed
infrasound data. More information can be found under the [Lokahi](https://redvox.io) project.

### Open Power Quality Project

Designed a software suite for the collection, aggregation, analysis, display, and reporting of distributed power quality
data. More information can be found under the [OPQ](http://openpowerquality.org/) project.

## Internships

### Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Granted an Academic Cooperation Participantship with LLNL's Big Data GNEM group from 2014 - 2016. Surveyed and implemented open source big data solutions for streaming seismic data.
